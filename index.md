# Nofar Carmeli

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.technion.ac.il/) at Technion, Israel. My research, advised by [Prof. Benny Kimelfeld](https://benny.cs.technion.ac.il/) in [Technion Data & Knowledge Laboratory](https://tdk.cs.technion.ac.il/), focuses on database query optimization based on their structure and enumeration techniques.
My work so far has focused on finding the fine grained complexity of evaluating queries and on enumerating tree decompositions (that can be used as query plans).
I love teaching, mainly competitive programming and combinatorics. I also enjoy participating in improvisational theater and swing dancing.
