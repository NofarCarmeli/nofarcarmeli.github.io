# Nofar Carmeli

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.technion.ac.il/) at Technion, Israel. My research, advised by [Prof. Benny Kimelfeld](https://benny.cs.technion.ac.il/) in [Technion Data & Knowledge Laboratory](https://tdk.cs.technion.ac.il/), focuses on database query optimization using enumeration techniques.
My work so far has focused on enumerating tree decompositions, that can be used as query plans, and on finding the fine grained complexity of evaluating queries based on their structure.
I love teaching, mainly competitive programming and combinatorics. I also enjoy participating in improvisational theater and swing dancing.
